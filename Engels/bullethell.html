                <p>
                    The story of the game is that scientists tried to make a new form of energy through a portal to another dimension.
                    This would be revolutionary as this could be an infinite source of energy. When they opened the portal for the first time they accidentally made a gateway from a dimension full of monster to Earth.
                    All scientists got slaughtered and the monsters tried to get out of the facility. You, the player, has to prevent this or everyone on Earth will be death in no-time. You're deployed near the facility and as soon as you enter you will be encounter with a few monsters.
                    On the first floor you can learn how to shoot and walk while killing a few monsters. On every floor you will find a door that will lead to another part or floor. The closer you come to the end the more difficult the monster will be. Eventually in the end you will enter a boss room.
                    You will first see a portal but as soon as you near the portal, it will go crazy and a boss will be spawned in the room. Your last mission is to kill the boss and close the portal.

                    Bullet Hell is a game I had to make for school, this is also the first game I made in a team with Game Developers and Game Artists. We had 4 weeks to make this game and present it to the class, I found it fun to make a game with artists as I didn't have to make the sprites anymore.
                    Team communication wasn't always on point as we didn't see eachother that often because of Covid, but I think the game is pretty fun and very playable.
