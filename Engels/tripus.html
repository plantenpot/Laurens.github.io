                <p>
                    For my elective course exam I had to design an app for a fictional company called TRIPUS. TRIPUS is a company which organizes group travels and they wanted me to design their app.
                    The main requirements were as following:
                    <br><br>
                    * Login screen
                    <br>
                    * Being able to upload photos
                    <br>
                    * Being able to like photos
                    <br>
                    * Being able to chat with your group
                    <br>
                    * Being able to save important document like your tickets
                    <br><br>
                    I started off by brainstorming about what I thought people needed in a travel app and doing some research about what other people think they need in a travel app.
                    I wrote down my research and started working on how I wanted to make the app look like and create the wireframe. After finishing the wireframe and receiving a GO from my teacher, I began working on the high-res version of the app.
                    I tried to make the app simplistic but also cheerful because going on a trip should be fun. 
                    All requirements were met; you are able to login and add your tickets to the app.
                    Open the chat for a specific travel and being able to send and receive messages and photos. You can find more information about the travel by tapping on the logo inside the chat.
                    Add photos to the app to review them later or send them to other people.
