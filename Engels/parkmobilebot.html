                    So at SintLucas Eindhoven there are no free parking spots for students. I really like to go to school by car so I don't have to travel as long and I am not dependent on public transport times,
                    but I do not want to pay €140 per month to park near school. So I found out that every first 30 minutes of your ticket are free.
                    And so I came up with the idea to just renew the ticket every 25 minutes so I can have a free parking spot all day.
                    I just didn't want to renew the ticket every 25 minutes myself, so I made a bot using Python and Selenium that automatically logs into my account and renews my ticket every x minutes.
                    <br><br>
                    They eventually found out and so now you only have 10 seconds to renew your ticket, which my bot can do as well of course.
