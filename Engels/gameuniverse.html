                <p>
                    GameUniverse is a website I have made back in early 2018. This was the first time that I made something with HTML5 and CSS3. The idea of this website was that I could upload all my games that I made back then to the website.
                    People who would like to try some of my games could download them from my own website. There also would be video's on the website that I made for instructions or just gameplay. Another feature that I really wanted to make
                    was that people could make accounts and chat with other users or leave comments below my games. After finishing most the website design I decided to start working on the database.
                    Back then I had 0 knownledge about databases and PHP and I found it hard to follow the YouTube video's were people made what I wanted to make but without much explanation of what they're doing.
                    I stopped working with databases for a while and continued to make websites and learn HTML5 and CSS3. If I look back at the website now I can definitely see that I have grown in skill as I would have done a lot different and simpler.
