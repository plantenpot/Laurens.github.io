                <p>
                    Gun Chaos is a game that I made on Roblox. It was first a totally different game and was called Shotgun Chaos. The main goal of that game was to kill as many other players as you could in one game.
                    The total amount of kills would be saved in a leaderboard that everyone that plays the game could see. The more kills you got, the more items you could unluck. For example with 100 kills you could unluck a new weapon.
                    You could also unlock cosmetic items like skins, wings, etc.

                    At the time I made that game there was actually already one game with the same concept that was pretty populair.
                    I wanted to make my own Roblox game for a while already and as this game was pretty populair and fun I thought I could maybe get some of their players to test my game.
                    After a few weeks I managed to make some maps and the main scripts for the game. I invited some friends to test the game and I received some very good feedback from them. Unfortunately Roblox made an update to prevent exploiters from exploiting.
                    Because of this update many of my scripts didn't work anymore and I decided to stop working on it for a while. After a few months I remade the game with a new name and some new idea's. I also changed the era from modern to Cold War.
                    I hired some people to make logo's and maps for me and I started working on the scripts again. It took some time but after I managed to make the core mechanics I once again invited multiple people to come and test my game.
                    This time I actually had a group of 8 people that regulary played my game and gave me feedback. The first few playtroughs were very buggy so I took some days to fix all the bugs and began testing again.
                    The group of people gave me very good feedback and I tried to do as much with it as I could. I even managed to make some very complicated mechanics which I didn't thought I could make at that time.
                    I was very proud of what I made so far and the game was pretty playable but very basic. I worked on it for another month and stopped. I have learnt alot from making this game and I am probably going to continue development on this game in the near future.
