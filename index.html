            <h1 class="text" style="padding-top: 5%; padding-bottom: 6%;">Let me introduce myself</h1>
            <p class="text" style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">I am Laurens van Baardewijk, I am 18 years old and I live in the Netherlands. I am currently studying Software Development on SintLucas in Eindhoven. 
                The first time I made a script was for a game on Roblox. Roblox is a website full of user-made games and I used to play a lot of them. I was always wondering how people made those games and how I could make my own.
                At first I tried to type some random stuff in scripts and see if it work, which it obviously didn't. So I went searching for YouTube tutorials about how to do certain things like making a brick change color when pressing a button.
                After watching a few YouTube video's I was able to make a small mini game on my own. Seeing everything work out the way I wanted it to really made me excited to do more. So I went on watching more YouTube tutorials and making more complex games over the months.
                Sadly after an update on Roblox against exploiters, these games don't work anymore. 
                <br><br>
                After a few Roblox games I came up with the idea to make my own website for fun. I didn't know how to do it yet, so I again went searching for YouTube tutorials on how to make a simple basic website. 
                At the first or second day I made my own very simple and basic website. If I remember it correctly, the website was meant to be a small portfolio for me but I mainly made it to practice how to design and make websites.
                After I was 'done' with the portfolio website, I continued making small simple websites like a login screen. But for a login screen you need to have a database and after watching multiple YouTube video's I was still not able to make a database on my own.
                It was simply too complex for me at the time.
                <br><br>
                After trying to make databases which didn't work correctly, I decided to stop for now and tried to make games in Unity. I found out that this has to be done in C# and that it isn't that easy. The first game I made in Unity was a simple ball race game. 
                I made this game with the help from a YouTube series from Brackeys. While creating that game, I played around with the Unity physics, particle effects, UI's, etc. I was quite proud when I finished the game after a few days.
                It was a pretty simple game, the goal was to go through different levels and make a high score. After playing all the levels, you could replay them to beat your current high score.
                I learned quite a lot from that game but when I tried to make another more complex game I found out that there's still so much to learn and that it wasn't really easy. At that point I decided that I wanted to study Software Development after I finished high school.
                <br><br>
                In my 4th year of high school I started to follow a hacking course which thought me how to hack SQL databases and exploit websites. After I finished the course, I once again began watching a lot of YouTube videos on how to install Kali Linux and tutorials on the different hacking tools they offer.
                I began hacking dummy websites and making simple key loggers etc. After a few months when the highschool exams started, I stopped hacking and concentrated on my exams. After that I stopped hacking and instead practiced more on how to make games and websites.
